# Module Manager
A plugin by Crypted#9928

Made to avoid cluttering in my "My Models" tab on Roblox Studio where i originally kept my modules.
I will keep everything "virus"-free and open-sourced, feel free to download and make your own version.

I think the MIT license was the correct choice, but i don't really care what anyone does with it, as long as they don't claim they singlehandedly made the entire thing, even though it's simple and could easily be made singlehandedly.
